### What I learned

This was a very fun project to do as I wanted to get familiar with using react router and learning how it works.
I'm definetely not solid in it yet so i'm going to be developing more projects until I can get a firm grasp on it.

### Continued development
- Develop more projects involving the use of react router

### Useful resources
